Keep-Me is a CRUD web application build-up using pure HTML and JavaScript, add with additional buttons and features to take notes or TO-DO elements from user and store it in local storage.

-   Items stored in **Local Storage**

  
## Tech Stack

- HTML5, CSS3
- JavaScript

## Lessons Learned

 The Project taught me about core concept of JavaScript 
   and different features of JavaScript. It also envolves local storage as a storaing space 
, so even learned a lot about local storage, how it works?, how to use it and many more.

 -  **Challenges**: There are two challenges that I had faced:- 
        
     - Creating a Dynamic note:- whenever anyone click on create it must add a dynamic html node
     - Connecting it with local stporage 



## Instructions to use

- Click on "Add Note" to create a node
- Enter your note
- Click on edit icon to save that node to local storage, Same is used for edit 
- On clicking delete icon the node gets deleted
